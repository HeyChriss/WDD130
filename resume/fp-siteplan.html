                        Tired of building resumes and not getting your dream job? 
                        My plan is to build a website where people could add a resume, add projects, build a profile, links to jobs, and
                        preferences according to the way they want so they can share that website with companies, People will have more 
                        opportunities to succeed and it will be easier, faster and cheaper to build an online 
                        profile than another resource people could find. People will get their dream job, and
                         companies will spend less time finding information because the website will help them find it faster and fancier.
