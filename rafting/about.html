                <div class="final2"> The first commercial river rafting trips in the United States were launched in Idaho.
                    Idaho outfitters always have been leaders and standard-setters for this industry.
                    Idaho also has more places to go river rafting. No other state can claim as many recreational river miles as Idaho.
                    The American Whitewater Affiliation counts more than 3,100 whitewater river miles in the state.
                    Outfitters offer rafting trips of all kinds for all ages and abilities. Families enjoy fun excursions on rivers such as the Main Salmon, the North Fork and Main Payette Moyie, and the St. Joe.
                    Sightseers like quiet flat-water floats on rivers such as the Clearwater, the Boise River and the Snake in the Snake River Birds of Prey Area.

                <div class="final3">
                    Whitewater seekers go for the Middle Fork of the Salmon, Hells Canyon, the Lochsa, Selway, Bruneau, Jarbidge, South Fork Payette, or Snake River, Southern Idaho.
                    Idaho outfitters take care of everything on these trips. Guides row the rafts or lead guests in paddling their own. They provide tents and waterproof gear bags. They cook all the meals, including salads made from fresh fruits and vegetables and Dutch-oven baked breads and desserts. 
                    They lead games on the beach and around the campfire.
                    Most Idaho river rafting companies carry inflatable kayaks along on their trips for the enjoyment of their guests.
                    Guides provide instruction.
